# Seatsmart Remote Server
This realtime server powers remote functionality within the desktop application 
[Seatsmart](https://github.com/thaddeusm/seatsmart-FHSU).  

## Scope
When Internet access is available, instructors can use the Remote feature to 
access basic features from a mobile device.  Data is encrypted during transport 
and this information is not stored in any cloud database.

## Core Dependencies
### Express JS
[repo](https://github.com/expressjs/express)

Express JS is a "fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for node".  The 
framework is used to provide helpful methods for listening for and responding to 
server requests.

### Socket.io
[repo](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io)

Socket.io powers bidirectional communication within an Express server, providing 
channels (or "rooms") for a Seatsmart host to communicate with their remote 
device.

## Running on a Local Machine
### Install dependencies
```
$ npm install
```

### Start the server
```
$ npm start
```
